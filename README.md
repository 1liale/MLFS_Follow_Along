# MLFS Follow-Along Tutorials

Implementing some fundamental ML algorithms from scratch (Inspired by Patrick Loeber's tutorial)

## Installation and Usage
As noted on Patrick's repo, the main dependencies used by this project are:
* `numpy` for numerical operations
* `scikit-learn` for data generation and test
* `matplotlib` for visualization
* `pandas` for working with dataframes and data loading

> Note that only `numpy` is actually used for the algorithms' implementation, the rest are just to make it easier for us.

## Goals
> Golden rule: Add one example of a class of algorithm per day or augment an existing one (following steps outlined below) 

Time Required Estimate: ~ 1-2 hrs per day

- Step 1: Experiment and modify examples provided by the tutorials to learn the fundamentals of each ML algorithm.
- Step 2: Improve on the provided examples (i.e adding regularization and experiment with different optimizers)
- Step 3: Augment on the existing examples with new classes such as ANN, CNN, and RNN etc
