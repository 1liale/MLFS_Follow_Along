# MLFS Follow-Along Tutorials

Implementing some fundamental ML algorithms from scratch (Inspired by Patrick Loeber's tutorial)

## Installation and Usage
As noted on Patrick's repo, the only dependencies used by this project are:
* `numpy` for numerical operations
* `scikit-learn` for data generation and test
* `matplotlib` for visualization
* `pandas` for working with dataframes and data loading

> Note that only `numpy` is actually used for the algorithms' implementation, the rest are just to make it easier for us.
